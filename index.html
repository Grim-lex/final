  <br> Gameplay and what's at stake </br>
  <br> The Last of Us Part I is a third-person, narrative-driven action game that highlights survival and emotional immersion through its gameplay. We follow the story of  Joel as he navigates a post-apocalyptic version of the United States suffering from a fungal infection that turns humanity into violent, mutated fungal creatures. The gameplay consists of a balance of stealth, combat, exploration, and resource management. Resources are deliberately scarce, forcing players to approach encounters thoughtfully rather than impulsively, with stealth being the most viable strategy. This encourages players to hide, listen, and plan their movements to avoid the infected.  The combat is brutal and grounded, relying on improvisation from players and quick decision-making. Exploration plays a key role in the survival of Joel and his story and ultimately tests players on their post apocalyptic instincts. </br>

  <br> Above is a sound clip from one of the deadliest and most common infected enemies within the game, called a Clicker. Players learn quickly that sound is one of the most useful ways to determine what kind of enemy they're dealing with, giving players an advantage when it comes to choosing a combat style. </br>
<br> This sound concept within the game reminds me of the acoustic mirror concept described by Anzieu in <i>The Skin Ego</i>(note 1).</br>
  <br> In which sound is exchanged between infant and mother, establishing early cues used to distinguish a response, which is seen destabilized by Clickers. Clickers are aware through echolocation, meaning sound becomes the tool through which life and death are determined. When the player makes noise, that sound is returned violently, breaking this reassurance of the acoustic mirror. Instead of confirming a subjective response, these echoed sounds mark us as the player as prey, turning those early psychic structures of attachment into a mechanism of threat. </br>

  <br> Narrative Arc </br> 
  <br> The story begins in collapse, showing the outbreak of an infection and Joel’s sudden loss of his daughter because of it, an event that establishes his emotional numbness and survivalist nature. Twenty years later, the world is broken into quarantine zones, militant control, and lawless territories. Joel is introduced as a hard-shelled smuggler, with his only motivation being survival. In the midst of our first task as players, being a smuggling job,  we are introduced to a character named Ellie, a young girl with no background or past attachments who happens to be the only one with a rare immunity to the infection. His initial goal and the set goal of the entire game is to escort Ellie across the country in exchange for supplies, with no emotional investment in her beyond the task itself. As the story progresses, the external struggle of the infected and the dangers they face while escorting Ellie transforms into internal turmoil and the development of Joel. These hardships soon translate and add to the bond between Joel and Ellie. </br>
